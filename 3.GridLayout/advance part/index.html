            <p>The sun rises in the east, its warm rays spread,<br>
                Illuminating the world, and everything said.<br>
                Its fiery orb lights up the sky so blue,<br>
                Bringing life and energy to all it shines upon too.<br>
                <br>
                It sets in the west, leaving us with its golden hue,<br>
                A reminder of the day that has come and passed anew.<br>
                Its power, its beauty, forever shining bright,<br>
                A celestial wonder that fills us with its light.<br>
