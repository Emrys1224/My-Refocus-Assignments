My name is Merlin R. Janoras, 37 years old from Laguna. I am a maintenance technician, working in this field for more than 15 years.

My hobbies are reading, cycling, gardening, cooking, and making electronics projects.

My goal is to become a web developer this year. I want to learn all the necessary skills to become a competent web developer. I want to be employed in a good company preferably with the option of working from home.

It was my dream to become a software engineer but I was not given an opportunity to pursue a college degree. I studied basic programing on my own and I can definitely say that I enjoy it. Being able to do something I enjoy while earning a good income would be great.
